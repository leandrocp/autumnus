## Sample Highlighting

Up-to-date sample highlighting can be found on the web page for this project [here](https://ember-tooling.github.io/tree-sitter-glimmer/).

## Usage

### NeoVim

This package is already available as part of `nvim-treesitter` as the `glimmer` parser.

You can also follow [these instructions](https://github.com/ember-tooling/tree-sitter-glimmer/wiki/Highlighting-in-NeoVim) to allow `nvim-treesitter` to use a locally-cloned version of this parser, which can be useful for development or trying out the most up-to-date highlighting.
